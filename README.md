## Formidable NextJS Sanity Template Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app router project using;
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org)
- [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/docs/sanity-studio)
- [Groqd](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/groqd)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
